# How to record a talk

So, you're giving a talk, congratulations! Now though, you've found out it's a talk that you need or want to record. Here are some tips and tricks on how to record your talk from the comfort of your own home/office/somewhere-sort-of-quiet.

## The Setup

To record a talk you'll need setup for sound, video and some source of light. You'll also need some recording software. 

### Sound

It's good to have:
* A quiet space
* A microphone that is not your computer's microphone

A lavalier microphone works well. Here is one you could order. 

How to see if your sound was good:
* Listen to it

### Camera

Here too it's good to use a camera that is not your computer's camera. Fortunately phone camera's work really well for this!

### Lighting

It’s good to have the light come from behind your computer screen, so that your face is well-lit. So, you could put a lamp behind or your computer or these are some lightning setups that are affordable that you can purchase and use your LSA funds for, so it’s not coming out of your personal pocket. 

Here are some good lighting tips for filming at home.

Here's a light you can order. 


## Recording

You might be recording on your own and don’t need editing, or do need editing and are therefore coordinating with someone else. 

If you are going to be working with someone other than yourself on editing your video, then talk with your eidtor! Talk with them about your idea and what you’re thinking, and you can work together to figure out a plan.

### General recording tips

A couple notes:

Stay entirely focused on your phone's camera.

Using a clicker for your slides will help.

It works well if you stand while giving your presentation.

Some people might want to record their talk and demo in one pass, and then record their presentation slides in a second pass (listening to your talk in the background for timing.)
